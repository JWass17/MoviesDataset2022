# MoviesDataset2022
This data science initiative aims to comprehend the numerous processes that turn raw data into useful knowledge.
•	This is a project that I embarked on to improve my data analysis skills using Jupyter Notebook. I explored methods of performing data cleaning, data exploration and data visualization. Based on this I was able to get conclusive insights from the movie’s dataset. 
•	The objective was to identify and formulate questions to assist in giving inferences and to perform exploratory analysis on the movies dataset and draw conclusions from the visualized data. I was also able to understand the relationship between runtime and movies revenue with further improved my analytical skills.
From this project I obtained the following competencies:
1.	Loading datasets on Jupyter Notebook using python libraries such as Pandas.
2.	Dataset description using python methods, functions and libraries.
3.	Data cleaning to handle missing values in the dataset.
4.	Data Exploration using python functions and methods. 
5.	Data Visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn.
6.	Git commands using GitBash, setting up a GitHub repository
